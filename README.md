# KotlinTestPlugin
Test plugin to test out kotlin plugin dev

Even if this plugin is just made to test out kotlin as a language, as I am a java developer, you can still use it!
It is a completely working plugin for 1.20.6+.

## Features
- `/fly` A persistent /fly command. Even if you relog the server (even restart it), your fly will still persist.
- `/gamemode` Enhances the /gamemode command. Allows users to also run `/gmc` or `/creative`. All commands include an optional player argument to set another player's gamemode. Persists the gamemode across server restarts.

## ✨ Special Thanks ✨
To [CommandAPI](https://github.com/JorelAli/CommandAPI) for their wonderful command api which made the commands so much easier to create and maintain. Please, show them some love, the author will appreciate it!
